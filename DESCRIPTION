Description: Parallelize a workflow that uses remake (Rich FitzJohn, https://
    richfitz.github.io/) by generating a Makefile, which can distribute the work
    over multiple parallel processes with system("make -j"). Windows users need 
    Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

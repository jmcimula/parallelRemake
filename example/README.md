This folder contains the example from [workflowHelper/README.md](https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper/blob/master/README.md). Run it as follows.

- Ensure that [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is installed, the [`workflowHelper`](https://github.com/wlandau/workflowHelper/) package, and [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) are installed.
- Run workflow.R in an R session to generate the [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and its constituent [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)/[YAML](http://yaml.org/) files.
- Open a [command line program](http://linuxcommand.org/) such as [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28OS_X%29) and point to the [current working directory](http://www.linfo.org/cd.html).
- Enter `make` into the command line to run the full workflow. To distribute the work over multiple parallel process, you can instead type `make -j <n>` where `<n>` is the number of processes.
- Optionally, type `make clean` to remove the files generated by `make`.

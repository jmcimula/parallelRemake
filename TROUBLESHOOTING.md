# Troubleshooting

Use the `help_parallelRemake()` function to obtain a collection of helpful links.

Some common usage issues are explained in the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) from [remakeGenerator](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator). These pitfalls are explained in terms of the `commands()` function from [remakeGenerator](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator), but the same principles apply when writing commands manually in  [remake.yml](https://github.com/richfitz/remake/blob/master/doc/remake.yml). If you encounter additional problems, please read the [`remake` issues](https://github.com/richfitz/remake/issues) and the [`parallelRemake` issues](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake/issues) first, taking care to search the closed issues as well. Please submit bugs and questions as [`parallelRemake` issues](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake/issues).
